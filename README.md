# UI-style-guide
CSS Framework for Safety Services

This UI style guide was created with the following goals in mind:
* Introduce a common design framework, enabling designers and developers to create and rebrand UIs in a unified manner
* Create a more polished and professional look and feel for West Safety Services products
* Provide reusable UI components and example code snippets to facilitate faster UI design and implementation

**Usage:** This style guide should serve as the foundation for the design of new WSS UI applications going forward. UI Specifications should be created using these building blocks, but there may be design reasons why deviations are required. Code snippets are provided as examples and are recommended for re-use whenever possible.
